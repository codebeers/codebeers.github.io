Due to some events promoted by Feevale University on the _academic week_
we must **reschedule the Code Beers** to **March, 17th**. So please, 
check your calendar and confirm presence on [Eventick][eventick], 
if not done yet.

The Campus 3 Rock bar, where Code Beers occurs, happen to be filled with
people from the University during the _academic week_ -- which was not
published previously. The bar could not garantee the space and treatment
necessary for _Code Beers_ on the previous date. This is why we decided 
on the reschedule.

Remeber the date! **March, 17th**.

### Call for papers and sponsorship

With the new date, the [Call for papers][call-papers] will be extender
until March, 13th and the final programme will be released at Sunday.

[New sponsors][sponsor] will be wellcome, since we have a bit more
time for negotiations.
