We're looking for small presentations (5 to 15 minutes) or lightalks that can
start a topic and motivate further discussion.

You can propose a talk or presentation through [Submition form][submit-form]
by folowing the link bellow.

<ul class="banners">
  <li class="schedule">
    <i class="watermark fa fa-pencil-square-o"></i>
    <div class="info">
      <h3 markdown="1">[Submition form][submit-form]</h3>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

The topics are free, but must be somewhat related to _Technology <small>(or beer)</small>_.

If you are finding it hard to choose a topic, we can suggest some:

<div class="topic-choose">
  <b class="topic">programming languages</b> <b class="topic">tendencies</b> 
  <b class="topic">internet of things</b> <b class="topic">tools and apps</b>
  <b class="topic">best pratices</b> <b class="topic">frameworks</b>
  <b class="topic">software as a service</b> <b class="topic">homebrewing</b>
  <b class="topic">mobile development</b> <b class="topic">startups</b>
  <b class="topic">conferences</b> <b class="topic">cloud computing</b>
  <b class="topic">wearables</b> 
  <b class="topic">...</b>
</div>
