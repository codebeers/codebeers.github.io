## Why would I be a sponsor?

Well, it depends...

Code Beers is an open/community driven event of developers.
That means that there it's not aimed for general public, so, if you want to
sponsor the meeting, would be good to know what to expect in return.

For example, it _you_ are a company seeking for _ninja developers_, Code Beers 
could be an excelent ooportunity to meet some candidates. If _you_ are a company
who seels _software as a service_ it would be an excelent oportunity to find connections.

Or you can sponsor us just to help the meeting and keep the discussion on.

### How to sponsor?

We seek mainly for money (someone must pay for the beer), but gifts like bottons,
sticker, coasters or discount coupons are also wellcome.

There is no form or paper to fill. Just send an e-mail to 
[{{ site.contacts[1].email }} and/or {{ site.contacts[0].email }}][sponsor-mail] telling 
us that you want to sponsor Code Beers and let's talk about it.

You can also contact us by Twitter, on @{{ site.contacts[1].twitter_username }} or @{{ site.contacts[0].twitter_username }}.

### What a sponsor can do?

Every sponsor will be listed on the main page of this website, with the logo 
and name provided for us, and on the meeting first-minutes-wellcome<sup>1</sup>.

Every sponsor is wellcome to show it's company, product or project at
the meeting, by a presentation<sup>1</sup> (~5 minutes) and by talking with
the participants.
