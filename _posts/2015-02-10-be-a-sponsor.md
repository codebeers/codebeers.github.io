## Why would I be a sponsor?
There are several reasons to sponsor a code beers event!

Code Beers is an open/community-driven event of software developers, so it isn't
aimed for general public...

Let's say _you_ are a company seeking for _ninja developers_, Code Beers could be
a great opportunity to meet some excellent candidates. 

In the other hand, if _you_ are a company who sells _software as a service_ it would
be an excellent opportunity to find connections with the people who made such decisions
inside the companies.

Anyway, you can always sponsor us just because you sympathize with the event itself.

### How to sponsor?
Someone must pay the beer, so cash assistance is the mostly needed. Off course gifts
like pens, stickers, coasters or discount coupons are also very welcome.

There is no form nor paper to fill, just send an e-mail to 
[{{ site.contacts[1].email }} and/or {{ site.contacts[0].email }}][sponsor-mail] telling
us that you want to sponsor Code Beers and let's talk about it.

You can also contact us by Twitter, on @{{ site.contacts[1].twitter_username }} or
@{{ site.contacts[0].twitter_username }}.

### What a sponsor can do?

Every sponsor will be highlighted on the event website main page, having the logo and name
provided for us properly highlighted, we would thank you and talk about your company during
the event as well.

Every sponsor is also welcome to show its company information, product or project at the 
meeting, we will reserve a time especially for you to talk with the participants.

Take a look at our [sponsor quotas][quotas] for details.
